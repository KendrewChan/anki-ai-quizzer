# anki-ai-quizzer

An Anki add-on that turns Claude Code (or Codex) into a study tutor, right inside Anki.

- **AI Study** — the AI asks you questions about each card, you type answers, it grades them and suggests Again / Hard / Good / Easy. You still press the button, so Anki's scheduling is untouched. Highlight any card text to ask the AI about it, or to change the note.
- **🤖 AI Window** — ⚙ Settings, ✨ Generate/Update and 📋 Today's Missed as tabs, with one AI chat beside them that can search the web, change settings in plain words ("use opus", "grade more strictly") and make or improve cards. New and updated cards wait in an `AI-GEN` deck until you approve and submit them.

Uses your own logged-in `claude` or `codex` CLI; no API keys.

**AI Study** — while reviewing, the card becomes rewritten questions, each with its own answer box. **Show original** reveals the real card.
